Board Management API Routes for Collaborative Drawing System

This module implements RESTful API endpoints for collaborative drawing board
management including creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion. It provides
the core API foundation for multi-user collaborative drawing workspaces.

Architecture Overview:
┌─────────────┐   HTTP/JWT   ┌─────────────┐   SQLAlchemy   ┌──────────────┐
│   Client    │ ───────────→ │   FastAPI   │ ─────────────→ │  PostgreSQL  │
│ (React App) │              │  Endpoints  │                │   Database   │
└─────────────┘              └─────────────┘                └──────────────┘

Security Architecture:
- All endpoints require JWT authentication via Authorization header
- Access control enforced at database query level (owner-based permissions)
- Encryption keys only returned to authorized board owners
- Input validation prevents XSS and injection attacks
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention (future enhancement)

Performance Targets:
- POST /boards: <100ms (includes AES-GCM key generation)
- GET /boards: <50ms (paginated list of user's boards)
- GET /boards/{id}: <30ms (single board with encryption key)
- PUT /boards/{id}: <50ms (metadata updates)
- DELETE /boards/{id}: <100ms (cascade deletion with cleanup)

Collaborative Features:
- Board creation with unique encryption keys for end-to-end security
- Owner-based access control (extensible to team permissions)
- Real-time collaboration support via board metadata management
- Workspace organization with board listing and search
- Audit trail and activity logging for collaborative governance

Error Handling:
- Consistent HTTP status codes following REST conventions
- Detailed error messages for client debugging and user feedback
- Proper distinction between authentication, authorization, and validation errors
- Error responses safe for production (no sensitive data leakage)

API Endpoints:
- POST   /boards           Create new collaborative board
- GET    /boards           List user's boards (workspace view)
- GET    /boards/{id}      Get board details with encryption key
- PUT    /boards/{id}      Update board metadata (name, etc.)
- DELETE /boards/{id}      Delete board and all associated data
